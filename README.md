# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description
 
This purpose of this project was to refactor an existing code base. Previosly, the HTML code wasn't built with accessibility taken into consideration.  However, the code had been modified and all non semantic elements have been replaced with semantic elements. In addition, alt attributes have been added to the image and icon elemrnts. The title element was updated and all links were modified to ensure that they work as envisaged.
